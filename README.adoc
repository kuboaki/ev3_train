== Building LEGO Train with Mindstorms EV3

This repository provides building instructions and programs for train and signal using LEGO Mindstorms EV3 running on the LEGO City Train rails.

NOTE: GitHub repository: https://github.com/kuboaki/ev3_train/

=== Motivation

In train control, until signals using electric lights became popular, people used moving sign boards to indicate departure or stop.

For example, at the beginning of the following video, a traffic signal using a sign board is introduced.

It is interesting that if we could test the train control with signal while moving it at hand.
So I decided to try using an old sign board signal, like the shown this video.

=== System Overview

.System Overview

=== Train(Sorry, Locomotive only yet...)

This Train is built using LEGO Mindstorms EV3 kits and LEGO City Train parts.

.Train(Locomotive)
image::train_01_w_cables_w_memo.png[{three-quarters-width}]

==== Drive Unit

Drive Unit provides a mechanism that runs on wheels by rotating a motor.

* M-Motor(Medium Motor): Drive the wheels.

Motors for City Train are not easy to use with EV3. Also, EV3RT (the development environment used for this project) does not support City Train motors. For these reasons, I 've been using the M motor from the EV3 kit.

==== Singal Reader

This train does not have a driver, so the signal reader reads the signals on behalf of the locomotive driver.

* Color Sensor: Reading signal.

==== Oparation Button(departure/stop).

The train accepts operations to move or stop the train with this control button.

* Touch Sensor: Accept departure or stop operation.

=== Block signal

This Block signal is built using LEGO Mindstorms EV3 kits and LEGO City Train parts.

This signal consists of a signal display unit, operation switch and a train detector.


This type of signal is called a block signal.
For safety, after the train has passed through the section ahead of this signal, the signal is set to "stop" to prevent other trains from entering the section ahead of the signal until the train is gone.
A traffic control method that allows only one train to run in a section separated by signals in this way is called "blockage control".
The interval between a signal and the next signal is called an occluded interval.

==== Signal Display Unit

Signal display unit provides a mechanism for switching signals by rotating the pallet.

* L-Motor(Large Motor): Rotating signal pallets for displaying signal.
* Touch Sensor: Detecting signal display motor rotation.
* Color Sensor: Detecting current signal for present.

NOTE: Stickers are attached on the bricks for reading the displayed signal. The colors are similar to the blue and yellow of LEGO blocks.

.Block Signal(Display Unit, Manual Switch)

==== Manual Switch

Manual switch is used to change singal.

* Touch Sensor: Switch signals manually.

==== Train Detector

Train detector is used to detect passing trains.

* Ultrasocnic Sensor: Detecting the passage of a train.

== Building Instructions

Not ready yet.

Please see `.io` files in `images` directory.

=== Development Environment

TOPPERS/EV3RT (Real-Time platform for EV3) and C are used for program development.
Older version codes should be modified to be able to run on 1.1.
We recommend updating to 1.1.

Of course, any other programming language that supports the EV3 will work just fine.

EV3RT on TOPPERS:: https://dev.toppers.jp/trac_user/ev3pf/wiki/WhatsEV3RT[]

NOTE: If you want to simulate using the hakoniwa-ros2sim environment, please refer to [How to simulate](hakoniwa-ros2sim_simulation.md) (sorry, only for Japanese).

=== Build Program

==== Clone this ripository in your EV3RT workspace

EV3RT has a default `workspace` for building programs.
Clone the `ev3_train` repository in the same hierarchy as workspace.

[source,shell]
----
$ cd {install_dir}/ev3rt-1.1-release/hrp3/sdk
$ git clone https://github.com/kuboaki/ev3_train.git
----

==== Build train's program

Move to `ev3_train` directory. And then build train program.

[source,shell]
----
$ cd ev3_train
$ pwd
{install_dir}/ev3rt-1.1-release/hrp3/sdk/ev3_train
$ make app=train
$ ls -l app
-rw-r--r--  1 kuboaki  staff  102204  8  9 17:48 app
----

Transfer this `app` file to the train's EV3.
For transfer instructions, see the EV3RT website.


==== Build signal's program

Also in the `ev3_train` directory, build the signal's program.

[source,shell]
----
$ pwd
{install_dir}/ev3rt-1.1-release/hrp3/sdk/ev3_train
$ make app=block_signal
$ ls -l app
-rw-r--r--  1 kuboaki  staff  104932  8  9 17:49 app
----

Transfer this `app` file to the signal's EV3.
For transfer instructions, see the EV3RT website.

=== Operate the entire system

.Oparations of EV3 Train System
image::train_control_system_w_yellow_signal_w_memo.png[{full-width}]

==== Run the train( t1, t2, ... )

. Launch the transferred program. (See the EV3RT website for how to start.)
. When activated, a warning horn sounds and the vehicle waits for an instruction to start running.
. Place the train on the tracks and put the wheels on the rails.
. When you press the operation button, a confirmation horn sounds and the vehicle starts running.
. When the signal reader unit (using color sensor mounted upward) reads the stop signal (red), an arrival horn sounds and the train stops.
. When the signal reader unit reads the departure signal (green), a confirmation horn sounds and the train resumes running.
. When the operation button is pressed, the train stops in the operation end state.


==== Oparate the singal( s1, s2, ... )

. Launch the transferred program.
. When activated, a confirmation horn sounds, the motor rotates, and the preparatory operation begins.
. When the stop signal appears (red saide down), the motor will stop.
. When the train comes under the signal, it reads the stop signal and stops.
. When you press the manual switch, the motor rotates and the signal shows the departure signal (green side down).
. When the train detector (using ultrasonic sensor) recognizes a running train, the signal changes to a stop signal.

=== Train slowing down before the signal

Move to `ev3_train` directory. And then build `train_slow_stop`  program.
This train slows down when it recognizes the warning sign near the signal.

```shell
$ cd ev3_train
$ pwd
{install_dir}/ev3rt-1.1-release/hrp3/sdk/ev3_train
$ make app=train_slow_stop
$ ls -l app
-rw-r--r--  1 kuboaki  staff  102552  8  9 18:35 app
```
Transfer this `app` file to the train's EV3.

You can save the first one as well if you give it a different name (e.g. "app_slow") when transferring.

Let's run it after transferring.

The video below shows the train slowing down before the signal.
